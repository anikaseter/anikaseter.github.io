            This is <abbr>BTS</abbr>. Otherwise known as Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단), which translates to Bulletproof Boy Scouts.
            They are a <abbr title="korean pop">kpop</abbr> group founded in 2013 under BigHit Music. From performing and speaking at the 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmQOZWNyWE" target="_blank">United Nations General Assembly</a>, being the first kpop group
            to be nominated for multiple Grammys, and reaching new heights when it comes to awards for their music, BTS is a name
            you will never stop hearing.

            <p>
                BTS has seven members. In the above picture, from left to right, their names are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>V, real name Kim Taehyung (김태형)</li>
                <li>Suga, real name Min Yoongi (민윤기)</li>
                <li>Jin, real name Kim Seokjin (김석진)</li>
                <li>Jungkook, real name Jeon Jungkook (전정국)</li>
                <li>RM (Rap Monster), real name Kim Namjoon (김남준)</li>
                <li>Jimin, real name Park Jimin (박지민)</li>
                <li>J-Hope, real name Jung Hoseok (정허석)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The members are often referred to in groups as <i>lines</i> - smaller groups within the larger group of members with a similar trait.
                For example, the <i>rap line</i> consists of Suga, RM, and J-Hope, while the <i>vocal line</i> consists of V, Jin, Jungkook, and Jimin.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good to know: In kpop fandoms, a person's <i>bias</i> is their favorite member of a group. As a BTS fan, if someone doesn't have a 
                bias, that's described as being OT7.

    <div id="Triple Run BTS">
        <h2>Triple Run BTS</h2>
        <p>
            A fun little fact about BTS is that there are three separate things that have the words "Run" and "BTS" in tandem.
        </p>
        <p>
            First is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKysONrSmew">Run, the song, by BTS</a>. This song was released in 2015 as the title track for The Most Beautiful
            Moment in Life Pt.2, and is one of my personal favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XisXVcbZEw&list=PL5hrGMysD_Gut5B6Mms1bpkv44LoOwEHz">Run BTS</a>, the show. This is a variety show that BTS has
            done as a group, off and on, since 2015. It just might be peak entertainment, as long as you can read subtitles really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4YwJCZRh5M">Run BTS, the song, by BTS</a>. This song was one of three brand new songs released on Proof, and
            was perhaps the one fans were most excited about - especially when, at their final, free concert, Yet To Come in Busan, they pulled out a 
            never before seen, complete choreo, akin to that which they did in their ealier years.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yes, there are three different "Run BTS". And yes, Google hates that.

            I've mentioned a hiates a few times now. But what exactly do I mean?
