            This is <abbr>BTS</abbr>. Otherwise known as Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단), which translates to Bulletproof Boy Scouts.
            They are a <abbr title="korean pop">kpop</abbr> group founded in 2013 under BigHit Music. From performing and speaking at the 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmQOZWNyWE" target="_blank">United Nations General Assembly</a>, being the first kpop group
            to be nominated for multiple Grammys, and reaching new heights when it comes to awards for their music, BTS is a name
            you will never stop hearing.

            <p>
                BTS has seven members. In the above picture, from left to right, their names are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>V, real name Kim Taehyung (김태형)</li>
                <li>Suga, real name Min Yoongi (민윤기)</li>
                <li>Jin, real name Kim Seokjin (김석진)</li>
                <li>Jungkook, real name Jeon Jungkook (전정국)</li>
                <li>RM (Rap Monster), real name Kim Namjoon (김남준)</li>
                <li>Jimin, real name Park Jimin (박지민)</li>
                <li>J-Hope, real name Jung Hoseok (정허석)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The members are often referred to in groups as <i>lines</i> - smaller groups within the larger group of members with a similar trait.
                For example, the <i>rap line</i> consists of Suga, RM, and J-Hope, while the <i>vocal line</i> consists of V, Jin, Jungkook, and Jimin.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good to know: In kpop fandoms, a person's <i>bias</i> is their favorite member of a group. As a BTS fan, if someone doesn't have a 
                bias, that's described as being OT7.

        <h2>Discography</h2>
        <p>
            BTS has a long discography, as is to be expected from a group that's been making music for nearing 12 years now. Here's a few of their albums/eras:

    <div id="Triple-Run-BTS">
        <h2>Triple Run BTS</h2>
        <p>
            A fun little fact about BTS is that there are three separate things that have the words "Run" and "BTS" in tandem.
        </p>
        <p>
            First is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKysONrSmew">Run, the song, by BTS</a>. This song was released in 2015 as the title track for The Most Beautiful
            Moment in Life Pt.2, and is one of my personal favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XisXVcbZEw&list=PL5hrGMysD_Gut5B6Mms1bpkv44LoOwEHz">Run BTS</a>, the show. This is a variety show that BTS has
            done as a group, off and on, since 2015. It just might be peak entertainment, as long as you can read subtitles really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4YwJCZRh5M">Run BTS, the song, by BTS</a>. This song was one of three brand new songs released on Proof, and
            was perhaps the one fans were most excited about - especially when, at their final, free concert, Yet To Come in Busan, they pulled out a 
            never before seen, complete choreo, akin to that which they did in their ealier years.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yes, there are three different "Run BTS". And yes, Google hates that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Where-Are-They-Now?">
        <h2>Where Are They Now?</h2>
        <p>
            I've mentioned a hiates a few times now. But what exactly do I mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            In South Korea, there is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea">mandatory military service</a>. All males have to complete military service between the ages of 18 and 35.
            BTS are all within this age range, and decided to complete their mandatory military service, despite the possibility that the government would waive it.
            They are currently completing their military service (except for Jin and J-Hope, who as of now have completed their service), and thus the group is on a temporary hiatus.
            We're still getting lots of solo content that was recorded before the members enlisted, though, so it's not like they've disappeared off the face of the planet (except for Suga,
            who has barely said a word since enlisting.)
