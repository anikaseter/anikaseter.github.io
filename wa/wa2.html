    <h1>Hello! I'm Anika!</h1>
    <img src="../img/meAtCastle.jpeg" alt="Me standing proudly in front of a castle."
    style="width:504px;height:672px;">
    <p>My full name is Anika Seter, and my pronouns are she/her.</p>
    <p><em>(Fun fact, I was named after Anakin Skywalker.)</em></p>
    <p>I've lived in Loveland, Colorado my whole life (before moving into the dorms down here).
        I'm majoring in Creative Technology & Design, and minoring in Korean and Leadership Studies.
        Outside of my classes, I'm in a <b>lot</b> of clubs, including Elevation Kpop Dance, Ice Skating, 
        and Magic: The Gathering.</p>
    <p>I enjoy creating, and web development is another medium to create within. Through this class, 
        I hope to learn more about creating in this medium, and I hope to create some cool stuff!</p>
    <h2>Anyway, here's some links!</h2>
